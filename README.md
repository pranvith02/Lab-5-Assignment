To run the Django web application and access the "Hello World" JSON response, start by navigating to the "MyHelloWorldApp" directory where the manage.py file is located. 
Open your terminal and use the cd command to reach this directory. If Django is not already installed, you can install it by running pip install django. 
Once the dependencies are installed, start the Django development server with python manage.py runserver. 
This will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000. To access the "Hello World" JSON response, open a web browser and navigate to the specific endpoint provided by the application, such as http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello. 
Note that the exact path might vary based on the app's configuration. Check the code within the app folders for the correct endpoint to access the "Hello World" JSON.
